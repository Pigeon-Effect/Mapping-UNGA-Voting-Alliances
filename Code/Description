UNGA similarity #3.py

This code is the heart of this project. 
Its the tool that provides a graphical userinterface to presort the resolution dataframe according to three parameters (timespan, country, subjects).

calculate_network.py

This function doesnt contain a graphical userinterface. It produces a total of 193 csv files listing all 193 countries and their similarity score.
This function also allows for the selction of subjects and timespan, but offers a more holistic cross country view compared to the single country perspective of the UNGA similarity #3.py

fix_csv.py

This function cleans the original Harvard dataset by removing countries which have been entirely absorbed by their successors and removes minor irregularities to allow for efficient parsing.
If you want to test the original Harvard dataset, you first need to clean it with this program.

First100Resoultions_1946-1948.csv

This is a sample dataset already correctly formatted so that it can be fed to the UNGA similarity #3.py Code to test the tool without the large harvard dataset.
